### Pariticpation on Talk

5) There are a few different tasks to accomplish when you are on the talk boards: 

- Answer questions under #asktheexperts
  - We try to have some moderator on the talk boards at least once a day to answer people's questions. We've asked volunteers to use the #asktheexperts tag if they have questions about a particular fragment. On the right hand side of the page you will see different tags that are clickable. Click on #asktheexperts to get to every single fragment tagged with this #asktheexperts tag.  If you don't see the tag in that location, then search for using the search bar located at the top of the page, right above the Notes/Subject Discusssions Forum. Please begin answering questions if they have not already been answered.
- Answer questions under the Notes/Subject Discussions Forum
  - The first board under "Scribes of the Cairo Geniza Talk" is entitled "Notes/Subject Discussions Forum." This is the default board if a volunteer wants to comment on a fragment they've worked on. While most volunteers are very good about using the #asktheexperts tag, they aren't perfect. It is always good to check for any additional questions on the board. 
- Answer questions under the Questions for Research Team
  - The third board on the page "Scribes of the Cairo Geniza Talk" is entitled "Questions for Research Team." If someone has a question and you feel comfortable answering, go for it!
- Tag appropriate people if you cannot answer said questions
  - If you don't know the answer to a question, please tag @judaicadh or another person who might be helpful and you have confidence will respond.
- Appreciate the volunteers!
  - Comment under the Notes/Subject Discussions Forum and comment on how cool the fragments are that someone found or thank the volunteers for participating. Interact!
