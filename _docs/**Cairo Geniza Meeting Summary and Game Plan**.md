**Discussion Overview:**

The University of Pennsylvania’s Libraries would like to partner with the Princeton University Geniza Lab on a transcribing game tool for Cairo Geniza fragments. Using the lab’s approximately 43,000 Geniza fragments (on loan from Jewish Theological Seminary until 2019) and the University of Pennsylvania’s approximately 650 fragments, the aim of the project is to create a game that will crowdsource the transcription of the Geniza fragments in an interactive and “mindless” game.[^1] The game would work by introducing simple matching as a fun tool to identify shapes, where players would not need to know anything about these ancient languages to play. By playing the game, they would move through a series of levels where they gained expertise in matching patters. For example, after a quick tutorial, level one might begin by matching a picture of an “aleph,” written in modern Hebrew script and the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, to a picture of the “aleph” written in the Cairo Geniza hand. If solved correctly, the player would be rewarded with points. After a certain amount of time playing, the player would transition to Geniza fragments where there would no longer be any judgment accuracy of the player’s transcription by the game itself because the player would be transcribing never-before-transcribed fragments. In addition, it was mentioned that perhaps at higher levels users could correct or rate other users for their accuracy in transcription. Another idea was to color code different transcriptions and users could rate their favorites, the idea that the most accurate will receive the highest rating. Taking advantage of the highly structured and predictable nature of some of the documentary texts was mentioned as a feature that might be exploited for game development.

In accordance with the wishes of the University, the data produced from this game must be made openly available for broad re-use. The game code itself must also be open source, extensible, and replicable for others. In addition, we hope that in the future some auto-complete feature is made available so that when transcribing long or difficult to decipher passages transcribers can see the most probable options for transcription. It is still unclear how after the project is completed the data will be stored.

With advice from Dr. Arthur Kiron, Laurie Allen and Laura Newman Eckstein will write the RFP for this project, while Dr. Marina Rustow with the Princeton Geniza Project will be the point person for the Geniza documents and transcription.

**Game Description and Requirements:**

- In need of a “mindless” matching game. Match pictures of Modern Hebrew or Arabic Letter characters to the pictures of ancient writing characters.
- Game should be sleek, simple, easy to learn, and addictive
- Level based game, increasing in difficulty with each level
  - For example, level one would start with a picture of a letter, but level five might have a picture of a word, and level fifteen might judge other players’ transcriptions
- Game must be nimble: For example, it knows that the player has been playing for a sufficient amount of time so the player has enough expertise to transition to playing the game with never-before-transcribed fragments.
- Game code must be open source, extensible, and replicable
- Game data must be easily exportable. The data produced must then be converted so it is usable for our scholars.
- Game must be easily able to import and understand many different photo formats and language scripts including Hebrew and Arabic
- Game developers must be able to work with a group of dynamic individuals representing a range of professional expertise
- Game developers must be collaborative

**Next Steps: **

- We would appreciate any notes or corrections you have to this early document and any specifications in preparation for gathering feedback and moving towards an RFP.
- We would like to begin to gather a list of contacts who might be helpful in giving advice on different aspects of our RFP.
- Arthur, Laura, and Laurie will consult with Steve Jacobs from RIT about possible collaborations, and about the RFP development. (Scheduled for October 28, 1:00 - 3:00pm)
