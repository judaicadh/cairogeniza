# Talking the Talk: Donations

In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation genizascribes!

**@stefriegel**: [#math](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math) [#math](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math) [#math](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math). looks like my boss’s excel sheets

**@ev111**: Every column is divided to paragraphs. Each paragraph starts with a line in [#hebrew](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/hebrew) that is a [#date](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/date). The dates have a gap of a week , from friday to friday . Each paragraph contains “fractions” where the Numerator is a [#name](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/name) and the denominator is an [#arabic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/arabic) [#numeral](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/numeral). The dates cover almost 1 year , from friday , 15 Elul , Heh-Tav-Kof-Mem (about september 1780) ,
to Friday , 13 Tamuz , Heh-Tav-Kof-Mem-Aleph (about August 1781) .

**@stefriegel**: maybe a paylist?

**@ev111**: The numbers range from 2 to 350 , so , the C.E.O was “milking” the company :) ADDITION : i see that the second line of every week starts with the same 2 names — Cohen & Levi .That means it has to do with the people reading the Torah in public at Shabbat , and their regular donations to charity . These rare donations of 3-digits must have been a special occasions like a wedding or a Bar Mitzva .
