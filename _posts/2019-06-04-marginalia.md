# #DataDeepDive: Marginalia

In this series, we take a deep dive into the Talk boards tags to look at how volunteers classify the fragments. You can read an overview of our Talk boards tags in the Sorting Phase Data review.

**Marginalia (285)** refers to the marks found in the margins of a fragment, including drawings, notes, pen trials, or illuminations of the text. For volunteers, marginalia are easy to identify as striking visual characteristics. For medievalists, marginalia can expand upon the meaning text, or provide an additional level of information about its scribe and/or readers.

The Lieberman Catalog and the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary identified this fragment as calculations of *segulot*, or protective charms from Kabbalastic tradition.
