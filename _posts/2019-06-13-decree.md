# Talking the Talk: Decree

In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation genizascribes!

**@citsci-rancho**: [#arabicscript](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/arabicscript) perpendicular over [#hebrewscript](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/hebrewscript) on recto?

**@msra:** yep! itâ€™s in a beautiful hand, likely a decree (that was partially erased? see damage in the center) in order for the large spaces between the lines to be reused (similar to the verso of [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/12505192](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/12505192) )

**@citsci-rancho:** Thanks ! I have wondered if a decree is always a response to the text across which it is written?
The visual tension between the two scripts is very striking, and leaves me wondering if the Arabic is an answer to the Hebrew.
