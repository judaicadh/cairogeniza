# Talking The Talk: Kabbalah Connections

In this series, we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation genizascribes!

Following the most recent upload of 15,000+ fragments from the University of Manchester Library, #genizascribes started tagging and commenting on a series of subjects with #circles and diagrams.

Volunteers started collecting these fragments together for and asked researchers for more information. An expanded discussion occurred on [Subject 30752465](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/1029/904296?comment=1493335&page=1) shed light on all these remarkable pages.

**@naturalog**: This one is really interesting looking, but the library page doesn’t give any indication as to what it might be. Anyone here have any insights?

**@citsci-rancho**: Yes, it’s amazing! @researchers what is this? And what’s up with those dash-dot lines in the lower right on side 1? [@noamsienna](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/noamsienna) not [#geomancy](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/geomancy) is it?

**@Chavi-NY**: No idea, but there are similar pages with [#circles](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/circles) [#drawings](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/drawings) . I’ll tag them too. My guess would be [#kabbalah](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/kabbalah)

**@citsci-rancho**: Thanks for retrieving this group of seven pages of strange [#diagrams](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/diagrams) ! These subjects seem to be pages of a book, possibly as you guess [#kabbalah](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/kabbalah) . Side 2 of subject 30752466 is all text. Perhaps it would explain what the diagrams on the other fragments are about? Too bad there are no helpful notes from Rylands Library on the content of these striking pages!
Surely somebody has looked closely at these remarkable fragments. @researchers can you tell us what we have here?

**@noamsienna**: This is a page from [Avraham Abulafia’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Abulafia) “Hayyei Ha’olam Haba,” “The Life of the World to Come,” which is a Qabbalistic manual written ca. 1280. The inner circles contain combinations of letters (“tzerufim”) which are to be meditated upon following the instructions written in the outer circles. That’s about the extent of my understanding — for more, see Idel’s [*The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia](https://books.google.com/books?id=j9lzLzrvidIC)*. [Here’s another example](http://braginskycollection.com/portfolio/hayyei-ha-olam-ha-ba/) of a manuscript of this text in the Braginsky collection. This fragment seems to be fairly late, by the handwriting — perhaps 17th or 18th century?
P.S. I agree that the lines at the bottom are probably just pen tests…
