# Talking the Talk: Geometric Flower

In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation genizascribes!

**@citsci-rancho: **The flower [#design](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/design) on verso may have been constructed by using a compass.
The petals enclose radii, and the border elements appear to be the same length.
This beautiful design has a hint of mystical geometry emanating from it.
