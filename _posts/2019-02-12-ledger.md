# Talking the Talk: Ledger

In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation genizascribes!

**@citsci-rancho:** left image resembles subjects 1249 8828 and 1249 8839,
but includes an Arabic seal.
[#Numerals](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/Numerals) in the text have a horizontal bar above them. On verso two large lines of dark, elegant Arabic script divide the page diagonally.
Informal script, accounting or tallies(?) and a scribble (or [#signature](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/signature)?) are scattered about the page.

**@dziakj1:** There also appears to be [#math](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math) as well as a [#seal](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/seal) . Perhaps this is a [#ledger](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/ledger) ?

**@citsci-rancho:** Perhaps it is a [#ledger](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/ledger), or part of one. I would love to know.

There are at least 48 very similar subjects. Many have hashtags [#math](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math), [#ledger](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/ledger), [#list](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/list) or [#tables](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/tables).
This subject, 12499254, is one of the two which also has a [#seal](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/seal).
Perhaps all are part of a single multi-page document?

**@js613:** Agree they are all related and all some sort of ledger. This subject has on the recto two blocks of text. The top line of the top block has 7 words; words 3–6 are סדר וילך שנת התקנ”ט (The week that the portion of Vayelekh is read in the year 5559 [week of Sept. 15, 1798]). The top line of the second block of text also has 7 words; words 3–6 are ס’ האזינו שנת התקנ”ט (The week that the portion of Ha’azinu is read in the year 5559 [week of Sept 22, 1798]).

The verso also has two blocks of text, one on the top right corner, the other in the bottom left corner; they are bisected by a diagonal line of Arabic. The second line of the top right block of text has 4 words: ס’ [וזאת ה]ברכה ש’ התקנ”ט (The week the portion Ve-zot ha-berakhah is read in the year 5559 [week of Sept. 29, 1798]).) The first line of the bottom left block has 3 words; words 2–3 are אל כפרות (on/of [Kaparot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapparot)). The second line has 3 words: של ש’ התקנ”ט (of the year 5559 [1798]).

That’s the best I can make out. Any thoughts [#asktheexperts](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/asktheexperts) ?

**@citsci-rancho:** Thanks so much!
I’m very glad to have a clearer picture of what these pages are,
and when they were written.

As of March 10, 2018 there are 48 subjects which appear to me to be parts of this document.
33 have subject numbers between 1249 8818 and 1249 8877.
14 (including two with differing [#seals](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/seals)), have subject numbers between 1249 9237 and 1249 9258. One is subject 1251 0233.
