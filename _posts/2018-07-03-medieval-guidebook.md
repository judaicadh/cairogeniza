# Talking the Talk: Medieval Guidebook

In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation genizascribes!

One of our moderators @noamsienna writes: “ Whoa! Super cool… Seems like an decorated list of places in the Land of Israel (Shekhem, Karmel, and some smaller villages too — Kafr Manda, Ammuqa, Yaquq, etc.) with descriptions of what to see in each place — a kind of pilgrim’s guide / map. I’ve seen some later examples of this kind of thing, but this looks like a fascinating and early example.”
