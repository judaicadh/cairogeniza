# #DataDeepDive: Calligrams

In this series, we take a deep dive into the Talk boards tags to look at how volunteers classify the fragments. You can read an overview of our Talk boards tags in the Sorting Phase Data review.

A** calligram **is a type of letter art: text is arranged to form a decorative pattern or figure, usually one with connection to the text itself. (An example would be if someone wrote the text of the Book of Jonah in the shape of a whale, or the story of the Seleucid desecration of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem written in the shape of the Hanukkah menorah.) There is also a Jewish type of calligrams, called micrography, which uses small Hebrew letters for representational or abstract designs.

During the sorting phase, volunteers tagged seven possible examples of calligrams in the project from the collections at the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary and Cambridge University Library.

In Subject [11605719](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/11605719), note the beginning of circular text in the center of the page. Itâ€™s difficult to tell from a fragment, but it could be the start of a calligram.

In Subject [12602097](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/12602097), we see what may be the start of a circular writing calligram. However, it looks more like a chart or diagram.

In Subject [11507806](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/11507806), a calligram is visible as marginalia along the bottom of the recto and verso. What do you make of its shape?

Although the page is very faded, the curved text on the left side of Subject [12506892](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/12506892) may be evidence of a calligram. What might the scribe have been trying to draft here?

Subject [12502376](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/12502376) is a divinatory text with prophet names. A volunteer tagged this as calligram, but weâ€™re not sure why â€” perhaps the triangular text towards the bottom?

Subject 12502706 contains Hebrew and Arabic scripts, as well as calligram in the shape of a rectangle with an X across its center.

Subject 21708283 is part of the printed Geniza, a title page of a book. These decorated letters are *not* examples of calligrams â€” the letters do not create a decoration. However, it *is* a beautiful title!
