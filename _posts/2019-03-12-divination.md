# Talking the Talk: Divination

In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation genizascribes!

**@citsci-rancho**: [#divination](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/divination) ? on verso [#asktheexperts](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/asktheexperts)
The [#list](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/list) resembles subjects 1250 2361, 2366, 2367, 2370, 2372, and 2375.

**@noamsienna: **Yep, itâ€™s a divinatory text ascribed to Avraham ibn Ezra, which uses the names of different prophets (here we see Mordekhai and Ezra). Each â€˜itemâ€™ in the list is a possible fortune, in response to a question.

**@citsci-rancho**: Thanks! Itâ€™s very rewarding to learn more about the various texts we classify. Reading a bit about Avraham ibn Ezra leaves me awe-struck.
Also Iâ€™m glad to know that the ENA numbers mean that the texts which go together have been recognized. I thought so, but wasnâ€™t sure.

**@citsci-rancho**: Side 2 of subject 12502354 also has three rows of dots somewhat resembling the rows of dots on side 2 of this subject. Both possibly for divination by [#geomancy](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/geomancy) ?
