**Cairo Geniza Meeting Summary and Game Plan**

*In Attendance:*

- Laurie Allen,     Assistant Director of Digital Scholarship at the Penn Libraries
- Laura     Eckstein, Judaica DH project specialist
- Dr. Mitch     Fraas, Special Collections Curator
- Dr. Arthur     Kiron, Curator of Judaica Collection
- Dr. Will     Noel, Director of the Kislak Center and the Schoenberg Institute for     Manuscript Studies

- Dr.Marina     Rustow, Professor of Near Eastern Studies and History at Princeton     University and head of Princeton’s Geniza Lab 

**Discussion Overview:**

The University of Pennsylvania’s Librarieswould like to partner with the Princeton University Geniza Lab on atranscribing game tool for Cairo Geniza fragments. Using the lab’sapproximately 43,000 Geniza fragments (on loan from Jewish Theological Seminaryuntil 2019) and the University of Pennsylvania’s approximately 650 fragments,the aim of the project is to create a game that will crowdsource thetranscription of the Geniza fragments in an interactive and “mindless” game.[[1\]](#_ftn1)The game would work by introducing simple matching as a fun tool to identifyshapes, where players would not need to know anything about these ancientlanguages to play. By playing the game, they would move through a series oflevels where they gained expertise in matching patters. For example, after aquick tutorial, level one might begin by matching a picture of an “aleph,”written in modern Hebrew script and the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, toa picture of the “aleph” written in the Cairo Geniza hand. If solved correctly,the player would be rewarded with points. After a certain amount of timeplaying, the player would transition to Geniza fragments where there would nolonger be any judgment accuracy of the player’s transcription by the gameitself because the player would be transcribing never-before-transcribedfragments. In addition, it was mentioned that perhaps at higher levels userscould correct or rate other users for their accuracy in transcription. Anotheridea was to color code different transcriptions and users could rate theirfavorites, the idea that the most accurate will receive the highest rating.Taking advantage of the highly structured and predictable nature of some of thedocumentary texts was mentioned as a feature that might be exploited for gamedevelopment.

In accordance with the wishes of theUniversity, the data produced from this game must be made openly available forbroad re-use. The game code itself must also be open source, extensible, andreplicable for others. In addition, we hope that in the future someauto-complete feature is made available so that when transcribing long ordifficult to decipher passages transcribers can see the most probable optionsfor transcription. It is still unclear how after the project is completed thedata will be stored.

With advice from Dr. Arthur Kiron, LaurieAllen and Laura Newman Eckstein will write the RFP for this project, while Dr.Marina Rustow with the Princeton Geniza Project will be the point person forthe Geniza documents and transcription.

 

**Game Description and Requirements:**

- In need of a     “mindless” matching game. Match pictures of Modern Hebrew or Arabic Letter     characters to the pictures of ancient writing characters.

- Game should     be sleek, simple, easy to learn, and addictive

- Level based     game, increasing in difficulty with each level

- - For      example, level one would start with a picture of a letter, but level five      might have a picture of a word, and level fifteen might judge other      players’ transcriptions

- Game must be     nimble: For example, it knows that the player has been playing for a     sufficient amount of time so the player has enough expertise to transition     to playing the game with never-before-transcribed fragments.

- Game code     must be open source, extensible, and replicable

- Game data     must be easily exportable. The data produced must then be converted so it     is usable for our scholars.

- Game must be     easily able to import and understand many different photo formats and     language scripts including Hebrew and Arabic

- Game     developers must be able to work with a group of dynamic individuals     representing a range of professional expertise

- Game     developers must be collaborative****

**Next Steps:                    **

·     Wewould appreciate any notes or corrections you have to this early document andany specifications in preparation for gathering feedback and moving towards anRFP.

·     Wewould like to begin to gather a list of contacts who might be helpful in givingadvice on different aspects of our RFP.

·     Arthur,Laura, and Laurie will consult with Steve Jacobs from RIT about possiblecollaborations, and about the RFP development. (Scheduled for October 28, 1:00- 3:00pm)
